# Weather-Forecasting-Tool
A command-line weather forecasting tool in Python that uses the OpenWeatherMap API. It makes use of GitHub Copilot to assist with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

To use this tool, you'll need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. You can sign up for a free API key at https://openweathermap.org/.

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a city name. It will then fetch the current weather forecast for that city from the OpenWeatherMap API and display the description, temperature, and humidity.

Please note that this tool provides a basic implementation and you can further enhance it as per your requirements, such as adding more error handling, displaying additional weather information, or integrating it with other functionalities.
